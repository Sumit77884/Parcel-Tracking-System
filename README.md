# Parcel-Tracking-System
Web application built using React (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), and MySQL (database). It allows users to book and track parcels in real-time using unique tracking IDs. The backend exposes REST APIs that communicate with the frontend, and all parcel data is stored in MySQL. Tools like Postman and Maven are used for testing and building.
